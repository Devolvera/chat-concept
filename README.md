#What this is.

### This is a page with some colors/typography/animations/etc for an iOS app.

As I'm slowly learning the concepts of web design, I feel as if I'm
ready for more.

## Ionic, AngularJS, and more.

I'm wanting to build the app using the Ionic framework.

This is for me to get more acquainted with js and such. This is also
for me to learn about CSS animations and other trends of UX/UI.
